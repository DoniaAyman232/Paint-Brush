# Paint Brush Project

Paint Brush is a Java-based application that allows users to draw basic shapes with different colors and line strokes. It provides features such as color selection, shape drawing, freehand drawing, erasing, and clearing the drawing area. The project demonstrates the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) throughout its design and implementation.
